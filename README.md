This is a RESTful API project built using Node.js and Hapi.js to manage a collection of books. The API supports CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), along with data validation and search functionality.

This project was developed as a backend learning exercise with a focus on modular code structure. It does not use Express.js, in order to explore alternative Node.js frameworks like Hapi.js.
